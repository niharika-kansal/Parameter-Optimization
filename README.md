##  Project Title
**Support Vector Machine (SVM) Parameter Optimization Using GridSearchCV**

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this assignment includes a classification problem where the target variable is `quality`. The features are preprocessed using `StandardScaler` for normalization.

##  Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
   - The target variable is separated from the feature set.
   - Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.

2. **Model Selection**
   - A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier is selected from `sklearn.svm`.

3. **Parameter Optimization**
   - A **GridSearchCV** is used to perform hyperparameter tuning over a specified parameter grid (e.g., `C`, `gamma`, and `kernel`).
   - Cross-validation is used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score is used as the primary performance metric.
   - Additional visualizations (like count plots) are created using `seaborn` to explore class distributions.


##  Conclusion
- SVM performs well with properly scaled features.
- Parameter tuning via GridSearchCV significantly improves model accuracy.
- Visualization helps in understanding the dataset distribution and model behavior.
